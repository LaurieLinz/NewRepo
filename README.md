Hi there!  Get to know me a bit better at [laurielinz.com](http://www.laurielinz.com), [GitHub](https://github.com/LaurieLinz), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauralinz), or email me lalinz303@gmail.com.

You can see this project hosted on [Heroku](https://turtle-paradise.herokuapp.com/).

This is a collection of projects that I completed while learning JavaScript, I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making them.
